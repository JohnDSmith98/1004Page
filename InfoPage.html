            Your account security is a crucial part of your day-to-day life in this modern age. Passwords protect much of your important information that it is vital to not have easy-to-crack 
            passwords and avoid repeating passwords across different accounts.<br>
            Using standalone password managers is one of many reccomendations made by the NCSC 
            (National Cyber Security Centre).           
            <br><br>
            This page is designed to assist you in creating hard-to-crack passwords without having to remember them, this is because passwords which are secure are usually hard to remember.
